Have Cheat engine installed https://www.cheatengine.org/ 
double click to run the .CT file and then select the game (need for speed 2012)

To change vehicles, double click on the word "value" and then edit the text in the window that appears then press "ok"
use the txt file i provided, but if you are using the CT file then you can literally just select the car from a dropdown menu
next, crash your vehicle into a car, wall, off a cliff (make the crash cutscene thing happen) 
OR
head to a jackspot and press the button that it tells you to when you approach the jack spot to jump in the car
Doing the jackspot method spawns the car next to the car you jump into and in my opinion is more tedious.

you might be able to change vehicles during races also, but you would have to alt tab, double click on something, paste a value, press enter, and then tab back in and crash the car
so like... really not worth it... also cheating is lame.

DISCLAIMER: if you fuck up your save file... its not my fault... because I said so... 
im just putting that there just in case lol

(Cars marked with (DLC) might not let you drive them if you dont have the dlc... im not sure. I say give it a shot)

A good reference for the performance of the stock basegame and stock dlc cars

doesnt really list the top speed in mph or kmh though but still very very useful
